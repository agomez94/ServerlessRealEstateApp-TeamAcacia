# Everett Enterprises Cloud Migration Project

## Project Introduction
Everett Enterprises, a prominent marketing agency for major social media companies, currently hosts its business in an on-premises data center. They've decided to transition to the cloud, aiming to achieve superior performance and significant cost savings. This venture is of utmost priority since they operate a client-facing website that needs to maintain seamless operations.

We've been contracted to facilitate this critical migration, ensuring a swift, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective cloud solution that supersedes their on-premises infrastructure.

Our solution will employ a serverless architecture on AWS, utilizing key DevOps tools like Terraform and Jenkins for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) respectively, lambda functions and API gateways to communicate to the back end and much more.

## Preparation
1. **AWS Architecture:** Leverage using serverless architecture as the company would perfer them not to worry about the provisioning of the services underlying infrastructure. Itiate a new design if preferred. The architecture will incorporate more then 2 DevOps tools.
2. **Infrastructure as Code:** Instead of manually creating resources through the AWS Console, we will implement Terraform to provision the companies cloud infrastructure and services.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up Jenkins pipelines to manage updates in real-time, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
4. **Visual Architecture:** Provide the customer a visual representation of the architecture using draw.io or Lucid Chart to depict the various components and their interactions.
5. **Jira Dashboard and Roadmap:** Illustrate the team's tasks, organization, and progress through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap.

## Don't Forget!
- Utilize AWS Whitepapers and DevOps documentation (modules) to find useful guides and information.
- Ensure the implemented architecture is fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
- Regularly update the Jira Dashboard to reflect the project's progress and current state accurately.

## Conclusion
This project is an essential milestone for Everett Enterprises as they transition to a cloud-based infrastructure. Your role in ensuring a successful migration using the best practices of DevOps and AWS technologies is crucial. Let's build a future-proof infrastructure that will drive Everett Enterprises' success in the cloud era.

# Everett Enterprises Cloud Migration Project

## Project Introduction
Everett Enterprises, a prominent real estate company, is embarking on a digital transformation by creating a comprehensive website showcasing their available properties for sale. To ensure a smooth and efficient development process, they have opted for a cloud-based infrastructure on AWS and will leverage a range of DevOps tools.

Utilizing AWS Lambda functions, API Gateway, and CloudFront, Everett Enterprises aims to provide a seamless and responsive user experience for prospective buyers browsing their property listings. By leveraging serverless architecture, they can efficiently handle incoming requests and deliver content with low latency, ensuring optimal performance.

To facilitate the migration and management of their infrastructure, Everett Enterprises plans to utilize Docker, a popular containerization platform. Docker enables them to package their application and its dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency across different environments. This approach simplifies deployment and promotes scalability, allowing the website to handle increasing traffic effectively.

In addition, Everett Enterprises recognizes the significance of monitoring their infrastructure and application performance. To achieve this, they will employ Prometheus, a powerful open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus provides valuable insights into various metrics, including resource utilization, response times, and error rates. By proactively monitoring their systems, Everett Enterprises can identify and address issues promptly, ensuring high availability and a seamless user experience.

To automate the entire development lifecycle, Everett Enterprises will implement Jenkins, a leading Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) tool. Jenkins enables them to automate building, testing, and deploying their website, ensuring that updates and enhancements are seamlessly integrated into the production environment. This approach improves efficiency, reduces manual errors, and promotes faster iterations, allowing Everett Enterprises to deliver a robust and up-to-date website.

By embracing a cloud-based infrastructure on AWS, leveraging Docker for containerization, incorporating Prometheus for monitoring, and implementing Jenkins for CI/CD, Everett Enterprises is well-equipped to transform their real estate operations. This strategic approach empowers them to deliver a high-performance website, showcase their properties effectively, and provide a seamless experience for potential buyers.

## Preparation
1. **AWS Architecture:** Leverage using serverless architecture as the company would perfer them not to worry about the provisioning of the services underlying infrastructure. Itiate a new design if preferred. The architecture will incorporate more then 2 DevOps tools.
2. **Infrastructure as Code:** Instead of manually creating resources through the AWS Console, we will implement Terraform to provision the companies cloud infrastructure and services.
3. **Containerization:** Docker will be used for packaging their application and its dependencies into portable containers
4. **CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up Jenkins pipelines to manage updates in real-time, allowing for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
5. **Monitoring:** Set up Prometheus to monitor their infrastructure and application performance.
6. **Visual Architecture:** Provide the customer a visual representation of the architecture using draw.io or Lucid Chart to depict the various components and their interactions.
7. **Jira Dashboard and Roadmap:** Illustrate the team's tasks, organization, and progress through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a Jira Dashboard and Roadmap.

## Don't Forget!
- Utilize AWS Whitepapers and DevOps documentation (modules) to find useful guides and information.
- Ensure the implemented architecture is fast, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.
- Regularly update the Jira Dashboard to reflect the project's progress and current state accurately.

## Conclusion
This project is an essential milestone for Everett Enterprises as they transition to a cloud-based infrastructure. Your role in ensuring a successful migration using the best practices of DevOps and AWS technologies is crucial. Let's build a future-proof infrastructure that will drive Everett Enterprises' success in the cloud era.
